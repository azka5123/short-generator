- **r/relationships** (Romance/Drama): Relationship dynamics, emotional growth, human connections

## **Format Requirements:**
- The story title MUST be written as the first line of the output

  - r/confession: "I need to get this off my chest..."
  - r/tifu: "This happened yesterday and I'm still cringing..."
  - r/wholesomememes: "Something beautiful happened to me today..."

- Do NOT put the title in quotation marks

## **Story Requirements:**

- **Time Constraint**: Give your story a specific timeframe (24 hours, one week, during a single conversation)
- **Object Significance**: Choose a mundane object that becomes symbolically important
- **Reverse Expectation**: Start with one genre expectation, then subvert it

## **Final Variety Check:**
Before writing, randomly select:
1. One character trait that's opposite to what you'd normally choose
2. One setting you've never written about before
3. One emotional outcome that challenges the typical genre expectations
4. One cultural or social element different from your usual perspective
