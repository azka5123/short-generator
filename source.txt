"The Lost Phone in the Woods"
Last summer, my friends and I went camping deep in the woods. No phone signal, no people, just the sound of birds and the crackling fire at night. It was perfect.

On the second day, while gathering firewood, I noticed something strange half-buried in the dirt — a smartphone. Weird, because no one had been out here for miles. It was an old model, cracked screen, but when I pressed the power button, it turned on.

No passcode, When I looked at the phone's wallpaper It was a picture of three people standing near a lake... and one of them was me.

I stared at the screen, shocked. It was definitely me — same jacket, same haircut — standing with two strangers I’d never seen before, near some lake I didn’t recognize.

Confused and a little creeped out, I showed the phone to my friends. They laughed, thinking it was a prank, but no one claimed responsibility.

We decided to explore the area more carefully. After about an hour of walking, we stumbled upon an old, overgrown path leading down to a small lake — the exact one from the photo.

Standing there gave me chills. But then something clicked — this was the same spot where my parents once took me camping as a kid. I barely remembered it until now.

And suddenly, it made sense.

I flipped through the phone’s photo gallery again... and found more old photos — pictures of my family, my dad fishing, my mom sitting by the fire. This was my dad’s old phone, the one he lost here over ten years ago.

We laughed, relieved. What felt like a creepy mystery turned out to be an innocent, forgotten memory — uncovered by pure chance.

I took the phone home, cleaned it up, and gave it to my dad. He couldn’t believe it either.

Now it sits on our shelf — a strange little reminder that sometimes, the woods give things back.
